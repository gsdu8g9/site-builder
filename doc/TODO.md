# To do

* Ignore files? (e.g. sass includes)
* Filesystem creates an (or uses a supplied) Iterator. Can we modify it, e.g. to add/remove files (add css frameworks, remove included files)?
* Could split TwigHtml & TwigMarkdown into just Twig and Markdown. How and why? 
* Fancier layouts with Twig blocks? How? TwigMarkdownBlocksTransformer? 
* More docs, doc-comments:
    * Dev: site-builder internals (how it works, how to extend it)
    * Dev: Writing a transformer
    * Tutorial - making a site
