# To do

* Ignore files? (e.g. sass includes)
* Sass transformer (can reuse bits of assetic maybe?)
* plugins
* chain transformers (or priority)
* more than one transformer per extension? (Switch getSupportedExtensions to supportsExtension?)
* Filesystem creates an (or uses a supplied) Iterator. Can we modify it, e.g. to add/remove files (add css frameworks, remove included files)?
